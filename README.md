# [Blank 4.0.0](http://blank.vc)

Light, powerful and free template for Joomla!
for faster and easier web development.

## Install

For developing on localhost download and install it like a normal template in Joomla! Open a terminal and go to the template directory to install it again via npm.

    npm install

Run gulp to automate less and sass compiler, css and js minifier.

Now if you change some files in folder css or js (e.g. template.less or script.js) and save them, gulp will compile and minify the files. Take a look at gulpfile.js to recognize the automation.
